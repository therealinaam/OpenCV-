Project: OpenCV for images 

In this project, we have learned how library **cv2** is implemented for images. 

Functions
--------------------
1) imread('image file that needs to be read', flags)
üèÅ Flags: it is the way in which the images must read (-1: unchanged, 0: grayscale, 1: color)

example: img = cv2.imread("lena.jpg", -1) 


2) imshow('Name of the window', assigned variable in imread) 

example: cv2.imshow('Image', img)


3) imwrite('new file which needs to made', assigned variable in imread)

example: cv2.imwrite('lena_copy.png', img)


4) waitKey(time) -- a function which holds an image for a particular time interval 

example: cv2.waitKey(5000) -- delay for 5 seconds
	 cv2.waitKey(0)    -- it will not close the window 


5) destroyAllWindows() -- a function which closes all opened windows
